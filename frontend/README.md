# PigeonSale frontend
The frontend component is created with React, MUI, Sass, and JavaScript Fetch API.

## Built With
* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [MUI](https://mui.com/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons)
* Other dependencies in ```package.json```

## Getting Started
To install dependencies ```node_modules```, run the following command in ```frontend``` directory
```
yarn install 
```
Alternatively,
```
npm install
```
To run the frontend in development mode, run the following command
```
yarn start
```
Alternatively,
```
npm start
```

## Maintenance
The frontend file structure is separated by features and routes. [Noted here](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html).   
The main design structure of the site is stored in ```App.scss```   
The theme colors are stored in ```_theme.scss``` and MUI themes are stored in ```theme.js```   
Original components are stored in ```components``` directory
